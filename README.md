# Safety Device for Fishing Vessels
Currently, small marine vessels lack any safety mechanisms for anticollision with other vessels. This often leads to collision of small vessels with huge ships especially during night time when the visibility is close to zero, which is caused due to many weather conditions like heavy rainfall or atmospheric fog. Very often, fishing vessels tend to turn off their power to conserve fuel when not needed rendering the conventional safety measures useless.

This calls for cheap, power-efficient and independent anti-collision system which can be easily installed on these fishing vessels. The currently available systems have a subsidized price around ₹35000.

We designed a cost effective system by detecting the power of AIS signals that costs around ₹5000.
